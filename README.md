kakel v0.1.23.676.a.45.k

This is a tile slide puzzle game made with Godot.

I originally created this to get familiar with Godot.  Its nothing special, but
it does work and can be fun to play.  Once or twice, anyway.

There are multiple versions of this available in the git repo on github:

master - Follows the 3.x branch of Godot
mono - Follows the 3.x branch of Godot, using mono
4.x - Follows the master branch of Godot
mono-4.x - Follows the master branch of Godot, using mono

I try to keep all versions in sync, as far as functionality goes.  However, if
you play one version and its different than another version, then most likely
I am in between updating which ever version is older.

I regularly build (export) these projects for Windows 10+, and Android.  I
also build them for Linux (Debian) fairly often as well.  I do not build for,
nor do I test on, nor do I plan to support, Mac or iOS.

Finally, I will be adding both GDNative and C++ module versions of this as
well (although I'm not sure a module version is actually usefull, as it
would also require a custom export template;  Hmm, maybe thats the reason
...).
