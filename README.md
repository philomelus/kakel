kakel v0.1.23.676.a.45.k

This is a sliding tile puzzle game made with Godot.

I originally created this to get familiar with Godot.  Its nothing
special, but it does work and can be fun to play.  Once or twice, anyway.

There are multiple versions of this available in the git repo on github:

3.x - Follows the 3.x branch of Godot
3.5 - Follows the 3.5 branch of Godot
master - Follows the master branch of Godot
mono-3.x - Follows the 3.x branch of Godot, using mono
mono-4.x - Follows the master branch of Godot, using mono

There may also be versioned branches not named in the above list that
follow their respective branch within the Godot main repo.

I try to keep all versions in sync, as far as functionality goes.
However, if you play one version and its different than another
version, then most likely I am in between updating which ever version
is older.

I regularly build (export) these projects for Windows 10+, and
Android. I also build them for Linux (Debian) fairly often as well.  I
do not build for, nor do I test on, nor do I plan to support, MacOS or
iOS.
